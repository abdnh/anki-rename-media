This add-on renames media files and updates their references in the notes.
Currently the add-on supports renaming media in a given field to names stored in another field. See <a href="https://github.com/abdnh/anki-rename-media/blob/master/src/config.md">config.md</a> for available options, which can be set from Tools &gt; Add-ons &gt; Config.
The add-on can be accessed from the <i>Edit &gt; Rename Media</i> menu item in the browser. This processes all selected notes, renaming media references in the configured field.
Currently the add-on doesn't actually rename the files, but duplicates them under new names so that it doesn't have to update all their references in your collection. This may change in a future version.
Different renaming options might be supported in the future.
