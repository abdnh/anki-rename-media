# Rename Media

Anki add-on to rename media files and update their references in the notes.

Currently the add-on supports renaming media in a given field to names stored in another field. See [config.md](src/config.md) for available options, which can be set from Tools > Add-ons > Config.

The add-on can be accessed from the _Edit > Rename Media_ menu item in the browser.
This processes all selected notes, renaming media references in the configured field.
Currently the add-on doesn't actually rename the files, but duplicates them under new names so that it doesn't have to update all their references in your collection. This may change in a future version.

Different renaming options might be supported in the future.

## Download

You can download the add-on from its AnkiWeb page: https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/238174499
