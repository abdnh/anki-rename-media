# Rename Media

Anki add-on to rename media files and update their references in the notes.

Currently the add-on supports renaming media in a given field to names stored in another field. See [config.md](src/config.md) for available options, which can be set from Tools > Add-ons > Config.

Different renaming options will probably be supported in the future.
